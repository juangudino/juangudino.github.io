  <h1>About Me</h1>

  <p>I’m Juan Gudino, a mixed methods researcher and PhD student in Health Services at the University of Washington. At the heart of my work is a core principle: people's stories are more than just data points. Especially the ones we’re not always trained to listen for in public health. My research honors the strengths and struggles of Latino and immigrant communities—shaped by my own upbringing in rural Iowa, where structural barriers and coping were intertwined in everyday life.</p>

  <p>My intellectual identity is rooted in epistemic justice, art, and storytelling centered around hope. I approach health not just as a biological outcome, but as a lived, historical narrative. Health outcomes are snapshots—but what precedes them, and what follows, is where meaning lives. I try to trace those meanings, and amplify the drivers of harm and catalysts of healing within complex systems.</p>

  <p>My dissertation examines how psychosocial strengths—like social support, coping strategies, social support, and social networks—can promote mental well-being among Latina immigrant women, even amid structural adversity. I’m also a researcher at Fred Hutch Cancer Center, where I help support the implementation of a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) focused on weight loss with Latina breast cancer survivors. Across projects, I work to build models that are clinically useful and community-informed, grounded in the idea that thriving is possible even in the aftermath of profound challenge.</p>

  <p>More broadly, I see public health as a space where we must document risk without reducing people to it. I believe our methodologies should be expansive—interrogating not only what we measure, but how, and why. I’m passionate about reimagining research as a collaborative tool for justice, care, and possibility. And I hope to continue this work in partnership with communities, institutions, and systems in pursuit of honoring the beauty of our communities. </p>
  
 <p>In my free time, I’m an avid recreational runner, a dog dad to Gaius, and a karaoke local (former collegiate a cappella baritone). I’m also trying to learn chess — painfully, humbly — and can often be found toggling between health policy papers and Catan strategy. At my core, I’m a curious, goofy guy who finds joy in stories, music, art, and side quests.</p>
