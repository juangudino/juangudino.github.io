     I've walked or ran 5+ miles for
      <span id="streak-days">0</span> consecutive days.

    <p class="streak-description">
I use this as a nerdy visual anchor. I started running and walking at least 5 miles a day because I wanted to challenge myself to be outside more and be more active. Here's to hoping the streak stays long!
